It will not be incorrect to say technology solutions are way ahead of business needs. Today’s businesses have transformed from their 10 year old avatars but there are other type of challenges that still hinder in becoming fully digital and ML driven. Let’s dive into few of these areas to really understand this gap and how they can be bridged.

### Technology evolution
Technology has evolved much faster than anything else if we look at history in last 20 years. There are many segments where multifold increase is seen in scale and speed e.g. data collection methods and devices, big data storage and processing capabilities, machine learning capabilities to classify/predict/analyze data for actionable insights etc. If comparing results with humans, these machine capabilities are even more accurate for any human can handle and perform. Introduction of IoT devices, streaming capabilities & real time data processing is well ahead of any technology that we ever saw earlier.
On the analytical side, machines are better in diagnosing human diseases, able to predict heart diseases from wearable device data, self-drive cars by computer vision and object detections etc. AWS now has in-fact full portfolio of codeless AI tools that can do wonderful outcomes all by itself.
On the third side is enormous computing storage and processing available on cloud at penny prices. It’s almost fully managed and quick to migrate from existing on-prem clusters.

### Business evolution
Businesses as well have enormously evolved in areas of automation, process compliance, etc where it impacts their operational & financial performance. This maturity is different in different industries wherein there are leaders like aerospace, medical sciences, banking, clinical research & retail whereas on the other side there are industries like heavy equipment manufacturing, energy/utilities, automobiles, etc.
It is very certain that all industries have moved towards digitization & automation where data plays very crucial role. Inarguably, the transformation speed is increasing in all industries. Not to forget, within the large organizations, some departments have progressed faster than the other.

Let’s now understand why we have this big difference between technology and business evolution. Let’s pick business first. Think of large scale steel or cement manufacturing company that has more than 20,000 humans working mostly blue collars. Their infrastructure involves large smelter units, super hot pot rooms, fabrication machines, dust, noise, heat and all sorts of physical challenges. There needs are completely different from a mind machine like Google/Microsoft where they can program quickly and prepare platforms for others.

The second but important difference is priority. What digitization does a cement company really want from its manufacturing unit. The best they can start with is daily performance bowlers on shopfloor screens, machine downtime trends, etc and to do this, they need to invest in data collection sensors, digitize data collection of man processes, train people how to record the data, blah-blah-blah. Then what happens after they get the charts, they just cannot trust the data. They need to now invest in data quality improvement program, have regular check on it and further invest in auto-data collection devices that needs additional time and efforts.

This digital program turns out to be nightmare in many cases and diverts the attention from the core operation i.e. to make cement…saying it bluntly. This is important to improvement safety, quality, delivery and cost for the company but then the message here it to understand speed of this change and when ROI hits the P/L accounts. On the other hand, sales data of the same cement company would be already having most of data on computers…and its needs to be compiled/aggregated and reported out. This is not as complex and large as dealing with shop floors processes and machines.

Some experts believe that it would take easily 5-7 years to digitally transform a large size organization and success rate is <10%. Yes, less than 10% transformation projects will be successful. We will talk about it in another blog. Now, if we compare this with Technology company like Uber or Amazon, in 5 years, their platform scales up multifold, on average adds 1 feature every month and spreads on internet limitlessly. On the other hand, microprocessor companies like Intel are continuing to double processing performance every 2 years (Moore’s law).

### How to reduce this gap
This constant chase towards a faster moving target is never going to end. Let’s be practical. Businesses have to make a realistic goal-based strategy that has short term checkpoints (usually 3 months) to bank some of ROIs, and be careful not to fall into the trap that leads to running out of money, project getting to indemnity & lost focus to become digital rather core operation of business.
Picking & winning small but useful battles will help businesses and then most importantly sustaining the outcomes.
