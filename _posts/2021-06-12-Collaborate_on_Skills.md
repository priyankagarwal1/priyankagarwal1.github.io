## Colloborate on Skills rather Hierarchies

The world is talking about creating value by doing more or getting more from it. But there’s big difference in what we people are aiming and what they achieve finally.

In many of organizations, current business practices and processes are not always designed to harness the biggest potential from their people. There are too many deviations from the what they say standard procedures and too many product lines. That’s a big difference between organizations having varied business/employee scale, wherein startups try to get each and every penny back and a flat organization is extremely delivery focused. On the other hand, large organizations suffer hierarchies and approvals and many a times, multiple teams competing with each other to get the business and resulting in contradictory goals.
What does it imply for employees who want to do more but aren’t getting the opportunities? The answer is not so simple; it’s a mix of factors relating to employee’s perception, competency, transparency & courage.

### Solution
One simple way to address this would be the IT Service Industry Model where employees are not always tagged in a single organization but they are resourced as per competency groups or project groups.
On the alignment front, many top executives believe that annual objectives shall be made all transparent so as to be able to connect well across functions/teams/departments. Workday has some great features but still it lags that level of collaborations while in discussions stage and then ability to seamlessly connect based on skills/priorities.
Do you know any such tool that enables this type of objectives/priority alignment at large scale?
